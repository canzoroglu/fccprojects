              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
              Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment
              to provide programmatic control over them.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
              control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
              for example:
            </p>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks,
              form input, and page navigation.</li>
