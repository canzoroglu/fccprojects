            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
            Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment
            to provide programmatic control over them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators,
            control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;
            for example:
          </p>
          <code>
            function greetMe(yourName) {
              alert("Hello " + yourName);
            }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
